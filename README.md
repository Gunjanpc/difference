In Agora's services, **Video Calling**, **Interactive Live Streaming**, and **Broadcast Streaming** differ based on their intended use cases, latency, and interactivity levels. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **Video Calling**
   - **Use Case**: For real-time communication between a small group of users, typically in one-on-one calls or small group meetings.
   - **Latency**: Extremely low, usually under 400 milliseconds, ensuring an experience as close as possible to real-time.
   - **Interactivity**: Highly interactive, with all participants able to communicate freely (two-way video and audio).
   - **Best For**: Personal calls, business meetings, telehealth, and classroom settings where full interactivity is required.

### 2. **Interactive Live Streaming**
   - **Use Case**: For live events where audience members can interact with the hosts, but the number of hosts is limited compared to the audience size.
   - **Latency**: Low latency, typically between 400 milliseconds and 3 seconds, enabling real-time interaction with minimal delay.
   - **Interactivity**: Hosts can interact directly with viewers, and viewers can communicate via chat, emojis, or request to join as co-hosts. This allows for a mix of one-to-many and many-to-many communication.
   - **Best For**: Webinars, online classes with Q&A sessions, gaming streams where audience participation is important, and virtual events.

### 3. **Broadcast Streaming**
   - **Use Case**: Large-scale broadcasts where a single or few hosts stream content to a large audience, but viewers have minimal or no interaction with the hosts.
   - **Latency**: Higher latency compared to other types, ranging from 3 seconds to 10 seconds or more, as the focus is on scalability rather than immediate interactivity.
   - **Interactivity**: Limited to one-to-many communication. The audience primarily consumes the content with minimal direct interaction, like viewing only or sending messages that are moderated.
   - **Best For**: Large events, concerts, news broadcasts, and online shows where audience participation is not crucial.

### Summary of Differences:
| Feature                | Video Calling           | Interactive Live Streaming   | Broadcast Streaming         |
|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Use Case**           | Small group communication | Real-time interaction with an audience | Large-scale broadcasts     |
| **Latency**            | < 400 ms                | 400 ms - 3 seconds           | 3 - 10 seconds or more      |
| **Interactivity**      | Two-way, highly interactive | Limited hosts, audience interaction | One-way or limited audience interaction |
| **Examples**           | Video calls, meetings   | Webinars, live Q&As, gaming streams | Concerts, news, large events|
